Dot Net Core MVC Application

Notes
* The Repository folder can also be called Services
    * The namespace would also reflect the same
* The Controllers and Models folder is not required we have it as it helps us better organize our code. The controller and model cs files can live any where.
* the Models folder can also be called as Entities 
    * the namespace would also reflect the same
    * this can also live in a seperate project it can be a library project which is a mix of repository and entities or it can be a protocol project which just has the entities in it.
